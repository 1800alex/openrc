The BSD Kernel Normal Form (KNF) style is used:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#BSD_KNF_style
Basically, it's like K&R/LKML, but wrapped lines that are indented use 4 spaces.

Highlights:
	- no trailing whitespace
	- indented code use tabs (not line wrapped)
	- cuddle the braces (except for functions)
	- space after native statements and before paren (for/if/while/...)
	- no space between function and paren
	- pointer asterisk cuddles the variable, not the type

void foo(int c)
{
	int ret = 0;

	if (c > 1000)
		return;

	while (c--) {
		bar(c);
		ret++;
	}

	return ret;
}
