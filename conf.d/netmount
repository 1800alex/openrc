# Depending on how mounting your network file systems behaves when your
# network interfaces are down, you may need to set the netmount script to
# require  specific network interfaces to be active. This file gives
# examples of how to do this:
#
# If you are using newnet and configuring the interface with a static
# address with the network script:
# rc_need="network"
#
# If you are using oldnet, you must list the specific net.* services you
# need:
#
# rc_need="net.eth0"
# rc_need="net.eth1 net.eth2"
#
# If you are using a dynamic network management tool like
# networkmanager, dhcpcd, etc, you should list that tool here.
#
# rc_need="networkmanager"
# rc_need="dhcpcd"
