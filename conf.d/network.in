# Assign static IP addresses and run custom scripts per interface.
# Seperate commands with ;
# Prefix with ! to run a shell script.
# Use \$int to represent the interface
# ifconfig_eth0="192.168.0.10 netmask 255.255.255.0"

# You also have ifup_eth0 and ifdown_eth0 to run other commands when
# eth0 is started and stopped.

# You can assign a default route
# defaultroute="192.168.0.1"
# Lastly, the interfaces variable pulls in virtual interfaces that cannot
# be automatically detected. 

# You can also use files instead of variables here if you like:
# /etc/ifconfig.eth0 is equivalent to ifconfig_eth0
# /etc/ip.eth0 is equivalent to ifconfig_eth0
# /etc/ifup.eth0 is equivalent to ifup_eth0
# /etc/ifdown.eth0 is equivalent to ifdown_eth0
# Any files found will automatically be put into the interfaces variable.
# You don't need to escape variables in files, so use $int instead of \$int.

# If you require DHCP, you should install dhcpcd and it to the boot or
# default runlevel.
