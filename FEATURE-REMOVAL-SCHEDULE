The following is a list of files and features that are going to be removed in
the source tree.  Every entry should contain what exactly is going away, why it
is happening, and who is going to be doing the work.  When the feature is
removed, it should also be removed from this file.

---------------------------

What: rc_sys automatic detection code
      - Functions for removal: rc_sys_v1, rc_sys_v2

When: 2011/03/01

Why: The original automatic sub-system detection is flawed in that it cannot
	 safely detect some variables (Using cgroups confused it to think you were
	 using LXC, and Prefix cannot be detect by definition). Also, almost all of
	 the detection requires that /proc is available and readable. During early
	 boot, /proc may not be mounted yet, leading to mis-detection. The readable
	 condition can also fail under some hardened kernels when running as an
	 unprivileged user.

	 The new rc_sys_v2 function uses the rc_sys variable from rc.conf. After
	 the removal, the contents of the rc_sys_v2 function will move into the
	 rc_sys function.
